/**
 * Code by Russell Graves, https://syonyk.blogspot.com/, 2018 AD
 * 
 * This code is free for anyone to use for anything.  It comes with no
 * warrantee, and if you use this in production without rewriting it and
 * understanding it, you're being stupid.  It's a proof of concept demonstrating
 * how to configure a FTDI device for the bizarre baud rate, and how to decode
 * the data.  That's all.  Nothing more, nothing else.  I don't even promise it
 * will work for you!
 * 
 * However, if you find it helpful and want to toss beer money my way, there's
 * a donate button on my blog.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Serial analysis for the TEC06 battery tester gizmo.  This is a bizarre little
 * device that runs at 128,000 baud, even parity.
 * 
 * However, it works on Windows, so I reverse engineered the protocol.  Partly
 * because it was useful, mostly because it was fun.
 * 
 * This code works on Linux with a FTDI 232R based serial adapter.  I cannot
 * promise it works on anything else - you may have to find your own way to set
 * 128,000 baud, even parity, 8 data bits.  It's a really weird rate.
 * 
 * The data frame coming across the wire (once you get the baud and parity
 * correct) is a 15 byte frame, 8 bit bytes.  Each segment is sent with the
 * highest byte first, if it is a multi-byte value.
 * 
 * 0-1: aa 6a: Magic.  This is the start-of-frame marker that will be found in
 *             all frames.  If you're getting a 3a5a prefix, you probably have
 *             your baud set to 115200.  That's not right.
 * 2-3: 00 75: Current set, in mA.  The current set is calculated by taking this
 *             value, subtracting 17 (0x11), then multiplying by 10.  The lowest
 *             set value is 00 16, corresponding to 50mA.  The highest set value
 *             is 01 6f, corresponding to 3500mA.
 * 4-5: 10 12: Battery voltage.  This is the current battery voltage in mV,
 *             offset by 0x200.  A value of 0x200 corresponds to 0V, a value of
 *             0x0db8 corresponds to 3.000V, 0x11a0 corresponds to 4.000V.
 * 6-7: 0b b8: Termination voltage in mV.  0b b8 corresponds to 3.000V.
 * 8-10: 00 00 00: mAh through the device.  This corresponds directly to the
 *                 reported mAh on the display, with byte 10 being the LSB.
 * 11-12: 00 14: Internal resistance, in m立, offset by 20 (0x14).  A value of
 *               00 14 corresponds to 0 (not yet calculated), 00 3c corresponds
 *               to 40m立, etc.
 * 13: 01: State.  01: Running.  02: Stopped.  03: Finished (terminated due to
 *         termination voltage cutoff being reached).
 * 14: ac: End-of-frame marker.  Always 0xac.
